				<h2>Welcome to the official HTS Coding Club website!</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>Brief Description: </h3>
				<p>As technologies continue to advance, the skill of programming is becoming increasingly important. This is why we initiated the HTS Coding Club, encouraging students to learn and explore the world of computer science. The main goal of the club is to provide an opportunity to the students so they can expand their knowledge in computer science. In this club, we will focus on a variety of topics, such as contest problems and creative development. Students will face challenges throughout this club’s activities and improve their creative problem solving skills, as well as collaboration.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Goals for 2021: </h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Encourage students to explore the world of coding</li><br>
					<li>Have members of the club build projects of their own</li><br>
					<li>Have members of the club participate in coding competitions</li><br>
					<li>Organize a team of students ready for more competitive programming</li><br>
				</ol>
